How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Much more easier to identify the changes between them

   This make myself more productive than before

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Unable to have a snapchat of each changes made like google docs which unlike    Git provide much more control

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Due to the its system design

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    In pull out the changes I made which able to compare the changes of the files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Due to its features providing more controls

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
